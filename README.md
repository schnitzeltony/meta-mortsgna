# meta-mortsgna: (more than) yet another distro layer

The target of this layer is to build images with the best out-of-the-box experience and to support developers with helpers for common tasks.
It has its origin Ångström distribution  - check https://github.com/Angstrom-distribution/meta-angstrom.

----------------------------------------------
### Additional global variable for local.conf:

* MORTSGNA_ARMV7_TUNE:
  
  If this variable is set to "1", all armv7a / cortex variants are build as
  armv7a.

  \+ Reduce build time/disk-space required when building for multiple machines

  \- Build optimization (e.g vfp/NEON) is not the best your machine can get

  Rules of thumb:
  * If you build images for multiple armv7 machines and don't need to tickle
    the last quarter of your machine's performance:
    Set MORTSGNA_ARMV7_TUNE="1"
  * If you are looking for best optimization for your machine and/or you have
    a fast build host with lots of disk-space: don't!
  see [mortsgna-armv7-tune.inc](conf/distro/include/mortsgna-armv7-tune.inc) for more information

------------------------------------------------
### The following image-features are (re-)added:

  * x11-base:
    Let systemd boot into grahical target

  * volatile-log:
    If set, journal goes to volatile /run/log and /var/log is linked to /run/log 
    which is volatile. NOTE: We change OE-Core's default here: In bitbake.conf
    VOLATILE_LOG_DIR is enabled so that all images are build for volatile log. 
    Since this is far off what others do change the default. See
    [mortsgna-image-logfile-volatile.inc](conf/distro/include/mortsgna-image-logfile-volatile.inc) for more
    information.

----------------------------------------------
### This layer contains the following folders:

[appends](appends):
  * All bbappends are stored in this folder. For each layer a sub-folder exists
    and the appends are dynamic: If a layer is not in bblayers.conf the folder
    for the layer is ignored (see conf/layer.conf).

[classes](classes):
  * [instant-sysroot-target.bbclass](classes/instant-sysroot-target.bbclass): Create a sysroot for target remote
    building/debugging - Yocto's suggested workflows are cumbersome for ad-hoc
    usage.
  * [instant-sysroot-native.bbclass](classes/instant-sysroot-native.bbclass): Native recipes inheriting this class
    install everything necessary to run into a native sysroot. For a
    quick & minimal native SDK gcc-cross and gdb-cross inherit this class.
    class to enable instant remote debugging.
  * [user-with-full-skel.bbclass](classes/user-with-full-skel.bbclass): Helper to populate /etc/skel in user's
    home at image creation time.

[conf](conf):
  * layer.conf / and distro configurations

[recipes-defaultconfig](recipes-defaultconfig):
  * default configurations for lxqt and xfce to get a preconfigured
    environment. Note that all data is stored in th image at /etc/skel
  * unpriv-user: A default non root user (named morona) member of many groups
    required for daily operations. It is shipped with home folder populated
    form /etc/skel.

[recipes-image](recipes-image):
  * All images for console / kde / lxqt / xfce ar found. allgui-images build
    images for all graphical environments.

[recipes-utlis](recipes-utlis):
  * udev-rules-udisks-hide-bootpart: Hide boot partition from udisks
  * Some tools (these are the only left from angstrom). Honestly: Have never
    used them but kept them if users come from angstrom and might miss
    them.

[scripts](scripts):
  A script collection
  * to write images or kernel only to sdcards
  * for changing recipe checksums automatically after version bump -> [update-recipe-checksums.sh](scripts/update-recipe-checksums.sh)
