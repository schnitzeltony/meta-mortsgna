# Problem with copying /etc/skel to home forder by useradd at image creation
# time is that user-recipe must RDEPEND on all recipes installing files to 
# /etc/skel. Otherwise content found in home folder is unpredictable.
#
# To get around, this class was created. It is dual role and can be inherited
# by:
#
# * recipes creating a user whose home folder shall be populated by /etc/skel.
#   The only action performed is dropping a file
#   /home/${USERNAME}/${SKEL_INIT_MARKER} to mark the folder for later
#   population.
# * images which get a postprocess command copying /etc/skel for those home
#   folders marked.
